Dear {{ $name }}, <br/>
<p>
Thank you for making InsuranceSocial.Media your insurance social media solution!
</p>
<p>
We are setting up a corporate Facebook page for your insurance agency. Of course, it’s important for you to have full access to this page! So here’s what you’ll need to do:
</p>

<p>
    If you don’t have a personal Facebook account, you will need to set one up.
</p>

1.	Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/">www.facebook.com</a>.<br/>
2.	You may see a signup form. If you do, fill out your name, email address or phone number, password, birthday, and gender. If you don't see a signup form, click <b>Sign Up</b>, then fill out the form.<br/>
3.	Click <b>Sign Up</b>.<br/>
4. Once you sign up, you'll need to confirm your email address or phone number. Facebook will send you either an email or a text message to help you confirm your account.<br/>
5.	If you have any trouble, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/345121355559712">click here</a> for help. <br/>
6. Once your Facebook account is set up, log in to your InsuranceSocial.Media account. You’ll be directed to log in to your Facebook account, so we’ll be able to invite you to be an admin on your new business page. <br/>

<p>
Thanks again! We appreciate your business.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
The InsuranceSocial.Media Team
